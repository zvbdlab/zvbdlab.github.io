Carolina is a visiting scholar from Brazil currently pursuing her PhD in Biotechnology. Her research, much like her personal interests, focuses on dogs and their healthcare. The main question driving her research is, 'Are dogs diagnosed with visceral leishmaniasis in my hometown also co-infected with other pathogens?'
