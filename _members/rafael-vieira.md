I was born in Olinda, Brazil. I earned my Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) from the Federal
Rural University of Pernambuco (UFRPE). Following that, I completed a Veterinary Residency in
Laboratory Diagnostics at São Paulo State University (UNESP). I hold a Masters’ degree in
Veterinary Sciences at the Federal University of Parana (UFPR) and a PhD from Londrina State
University (UEL), Brazil.

In 2011, I started my tenure-track appointment as an Assistant Professor of Epidemiology,
Zoonosis and Public Health at the Federal University of Paraiba (UFPB) in Brazil. I received
tenure at UFPB in 2013. In 2014, I joined the faculty at the Federal University of Parana (UFPR)
in Brazil as an Associate Professor of Zoonoses and Epidemiology of Vector-Borne Diseases
(VBDs).

In 2023, I joined the faculty at UNC Charlotte as an Assistant Professor of One Health, being also
a member of the Center for Computational Intelligence to Predict Health and Environmental
Risks (CIPHER), where I established the Zoonotic and Vector-Borne Diseases Laboratory.

My research focuses on One Health, emphasizing vector-borne (VBDs) and zoonotic diseases,
particularly (re)emerging tick-borne pathogens (TBP), and pathogen discovery. I maintain a
sustainable interdisciplinary research agenda to examine transmission pathways, integrating
genomics and eco-epidemiological data to identify root causes, and promote One Health
through applied education and prevention, training, research, and outreach.
