# Ticks Make Us Tick

The ZVBD Lab at UNC Charlotte is a team of researchers focused on One Health studies, with a
particular emphasis on vector-borne and zoonotic diseases. Our research particularly targets
(re)emerging tick-borne pathogens and pathogen discovery. We aim to investigate transmission
pathways by integrating genomics and eco-epidemiological data to identify root causes.
Through applied education and prevention, training, research, and outreach, we promote One
Health principles and work to advance disease prevention strategies.
